                <p>
                    when people think of graphs in a browser, the natural thought is vector graphics and SVG, which quickly leads to visualization powerhouse d3.js. It really is an amazing piece of tech with a vast library of useful code to accompany it. Unfortunately, d3's core is intricately tied to the DOM through SVG and CSS. And that means ironically that d3 is not really capable of 3D.  You should be able to drop in a mathematical expression with as little fanfare as possible and have it come out looking right.
