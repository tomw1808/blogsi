                   These days, it is not very common anymore to get hand selected information ... for free. I will not promis anything like "this section will be updated regularly" but I'll try. I will try to
                    put the resource here that I use for myself. Think of it as a public bookmark with description what it can do for you.

                    We are right now working on a tutorial about the roleplay between a RESTful Interface between Angular and ZF 1.12. We are new to
                    things like Yeoman, Bower and Grunt, have no idea about anything but want to automate as much as possible. This is where we are going to start.
