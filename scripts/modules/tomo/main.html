                    These days, it is not very common anymore to get hand selected information ... for free. I will not
                    promis anything like "this section will be updated regularly" but I'll try. I will try to
                    put the resource here that I use for myself. Think of it as a public bookmark with description what
                    it can do for you.

                <p>
                    The cool stuff section and this section might overlap a little bit. This section here focuses more on real web-development,
                    the "cool stuff" section focuses on stuff I came across which is cool. Both are must-haves, of course! ;)

                    Getting Stock photos these days is not very easy. Especially the cheap ones (free) for a diversity
                    of usage scenarios. The following list of links should help you getting started with your
                    website or project. On commercial sites, you usually directly bill your clients if you took any
                    pictures from big sites like istockphoto.com. At least we do.

                <p>Finding great stock photos is a pain. You’re left with either low-res amateur photos, people
                    wearing cheesy headsets, or photos that are out of budget for the project you’re working
                    on.</p>
